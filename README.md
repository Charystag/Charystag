<!-- The goal is to write a README file for my repository Charystag/Charystag on github-->
# Ahoy Captain ⚓️! Welcome to my GitHub page!

# Introduction

## Who am I?

I am a software engineer, currently a student at 42 Paris. I am passionate about programming and I am always looking for new challenges. As my username suggests it, I am a big fan of automation and I am always looking for ways to make my life easier. I took a strong interest in bash scripting and am currently writting tons of scripts to automate my daily tasks.

I am basically a documentation lover. 
I love to read and write documentation because I think it is the best way to communicate with the people, be they developpers or users.

1. Reading documentation allows me to prevent any obvious bug and to ensure that the code I write using any software/library complies with 
how the software or library should be used. Basically all the bugs that happen because one don't read the documentation are 
stupid bugs. I'd rather spend 10 or 20 more minutes reading the doc than spending 1 or 2 hours debugging stupid mistakes.

2. Writting documentation allows me to keep an organized memo of how to use the project and how it works (or is intended to work). I assume that there 
will come a time at which I'll forget all about the project and I will need said documentation to use it and maintain it if I need to work on it again. 
I consider my GitHub account like a personnal diary of code where I can experiment and record all my progress.

## What can you find here?

On my account you will find a lot of my personnal projects. I love to automate things and to do so in a user friendly way (being lazy is being efficient). <br/>
My pinned repositories are the ones I've been working on lately, but feel free to check out my other repositories, you might find something that suits your needs.
You'll also find a repository called [Learning Material](https://github.com/Charystag/Learning_Material) where you'll find a lot of useful ressources to 
learn (or enhance) your programming skills.

# Tutorials

I recently started to share what I learned during my programming journey. 

- [Solutions to the Overthewire Challenges](https://github.com/Charystag/Overthewire-solutions) *Right now, I've fully documented the 
[bandit](https://github.com/Charystag/Overthewire-solutions/tree/master/bandit) challenge*

# Ressources

I've been gathering a lot of ressources which I found useful and relevant (some of them were very helpful), they are all listed [here](https://github.com/Charystag/Learning-Material).

# Contact

You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahsaintonge) or send me an [email](mailto:Charystag@proton.me). I am always looking for new projects to work on and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills.
At the moment, I am looking to apply my bash skills to work on some automation projects for a company. If you have any project that you think I could help with, feel free to contact me.
