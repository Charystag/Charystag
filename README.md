<!-- The goal is to write a README file for my repository nsainton/nsainton on github-->
# Ahoy Captain ⚓️! Welcome to my GitHub page!

# Introduction

## Who am I?

I am a software engineer, currently a student at 42 Paris. I am passionate about programming and I am always looking for new challenges. As my username suggests it, I am a big fan of automation and I am always looking for ways to make my life easier. I took a strong interest in bash scripting and am currently writting tons of scripts to automate my daily tasks.

## What can you find here?

On my account you will find a lot of my personnal projects. I love to automate things and to do so in a user friendly way (being lazy is being efficient). <br/>
My pinned repositories are the ones I've been working on lately, but feel free to check out my other repositories, you might find something that suits your needs.
