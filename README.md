# üöÄ Innovating with Automation: From Ideas to Real-World Solutions üí°

## Introduction {#introduction}

Hey there! üëã I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating **innovative solutions** to real-world problems using **automation**. 
I believe in working smarter, not harder, and I love automating complex workflows to make life easier. 
From **Bash scripting** to building custom tools, I‚Äôm constantly seeking ways to solve challenges creatively.

I'm also a strong advocate of clear and concise **documentation**. 
I see it as an essential part of delivering efficient solutions, whether for developers or users. 
By reading and writing documentation, I prevent unnecessary bugs and create a roadmap for myself and others to navigate projects with ease.

Explore my repositories, where you'll find **personal projects** focused on automation, 
and a curated collection of [**learning materials**](https://github.com/Charystag/Learning-Material) to help enhance your programming skills.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects {#projects}

Here are some of the projects where I‚Äôve applied automation to tackle real-world challenges:

1. [Markdown Links Checker](https://github.com/Charystag/markdown_links_checker) - üîó **Validating URLs in Markdown Documents**
   A tool designed to check the validity of HTTP(S) URLs in Markdown documents. This script automates the process of verifying links, making sure that documentation remains accurate and functional. It‚Äôs perfect for anyone maintaining markdown-based documentation with external links.
   - **Tools Used:** Bash, curl

2. [Classcreator](https://github.com/Charystag/classcreator) - üöÄ **Automating C++ Class Creation**
   A Bash script that automates the process of creating classes in C++. This tool helps speed up C++ development by eliminating repetitive tasks, allowing developers to focus on writing actual code.
   - **Tools Used:** Bash

3. [Video Tutorial](https://github.com/Charystag/video_tutorial) - üé¨ **Automating Video Demos for Scripts**
   This script automates the creation of video demonstrations for other scripts, making it easier to showcase and share coding tutorials. No need for manual screen recording setups!
   - **Tools Used:** Bash

4. [Man Reader](https://github.com/Charystag/man_reader) - üìñ **Simplifying the Reading of Man Pages**
   A Bash script that helps navigate through Linux man pages more easily, making it faster to find the exact information needed. Perfect for developers who want to streamline their terminal workflow.
   - **Tools Used:** Bash, Linux

5. [Lazyprototypes](https://github.com/Charystag/lazyprototypes) - üìù **Generating C Function Prototypes Automatically**
   A C-based tool that generates prototypes for C functions, automating the tedious task of writing them manually. This tool reduces development time and ensures consistency in code structure.
   - **Tools Used:** C, Bash


# Tutorials

I recently started to share what I learned during my programming journey. 

- [Solutions to the Overthewire Challenges](https://github.com/Charystag/Overthewire-solutions) *Right now, I've fully documented the 
[bandit](https://github.com/Charystag/Overthewire-solutions/tree/master/bandit) challenge*

# Ressources

I've been gathering a lot of ressources which I found useful and relevant (some of them were very helpful), they are all listed [here](https://github.com/Charystag/Learning-Material).

# Contact

You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahsaintonge) or send me an [email](mailto:Charystag@proton.me). I am always looking for new projects to work on and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills.
At the moment, I am looking to apply my bash skills to work on some automation projects for a company. If you have any project that you think I could help with, feel free to contact me.
